### Project Title
Exploring Bikeshare Dataset using R

### Description
In order to successfully complete the Programming for Data Science with R Nanodegree Program R software was used  to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answered interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics and by making visualizations.

### Files used
UdacityProject_Bikeshare.py
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv

### Recommended software
The Explore-Bikeshare.R file can be viewed on RStudio, which can be downloaded from https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

### Credits
This Project was made possible through the support and guidance from the Udacity's course: Programming for Data Science with R Nanodegree Program
